# Sea Of Time

Free man, you will always cherish the sea! 
The sea is your mirror; you contemplate your soul 
In the infinite unrolling of its billows;

Charles Baudelaire

This piece is called Sea Of Times and was inspired by Jean-Claude Ameisen’s book “Sur les Epaules de Darwin” (On Darwin’s Shoulders).

It represents the eternally evolving present as a wave on the sea, formed from both the past and the future.
